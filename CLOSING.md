## Project Summary

**Project Name:** MQTT System Monitoring Service  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Closed (Production Deployed)

## Purpose

This project provides a production-ready, modular Python application to collect system telemetry and attributes from a Raspberry Pi and send it to ThingsBoard via MQTT. It includes robust logging, configuration management, and unit testing with `pytest`.

## Closing Reason

This project has achieved its primary goals:
- ðŸŸ¢ Production deployment completed on target Raspberry Pi devices.
- ðŸŸ¢ System telemetry and attributes (including MAC/IP address) are sent to ThingsBoard reliably.
- ðŸŸ¢ Unit tests have been implemented for core modules.
- ðŸŸ¢ Logging, environment configuration, and systemd service are properly set up.

## Notes for Future Work

- **Separate project for aquarium monitoring** using TDD principles.
- **Future iterations** may include Docker support or additional telemetry sources (GPIO, sensors).
- Polling periods differ between dev and production environments; this is currently managed manually via `config.json`.

## Final Actions Taken

- Merged all development work into `main` branch.
- Tagged `v1.0.0` release.
- Deployed systemd service on production Raspberry Pi.

## How to Resume

If resuming this project:
- Clone the `main` branch.
- Review `README.md` for installation steps.
- Check systemd service file (`mqtt_system_monitoring.service`) for proper setup.

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
